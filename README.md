# Math Pro Font LaTeX Package

A LaTeX package providing the MPro font family for use with LuaLaTeX, including
support for mathematical typesetting.

The goal is to provide a decent font that looks good printed and on screen. I
took inspiration from Garamond-like classic fonts from books I found at the
Senate House Library (London, UK).

The focus is to display mathematical typesetting, therefore the name "mpro"
(Math Pro Font).

This package is shared under the OFL (Open Font License) and is free to use.
